# Cryostat heat load test

D. Leitner took some cryostat heat load data in the mid-2000s for 28 GHz operation.  
This script will set us up to repeat those measurements as well as repeat our own using 
18 GHz mixed in or 18 GHz independently to see if we can make a guess as to what to
expect from running 45 GHz in MARS
