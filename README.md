# Cryostat heat load test

D. Leitner took some cryostat heat load data in the mid-2000s for 28 GHz operation.  This script will set us up to repeat those measurements as well as repeat our own using 18 GHz mixed in or 18 GHz independently to see if we can make a guess as to what to expect from running 45 GHz in MARS

Planned steps:
1. Set magnets
2. Get base LHe heating
3. Raise RF
4. Measure LHe heating
5. Repeat from Raise RF (3) until LHe heating approaches zero
1. Repeat from set magnets (1)
